module.exports = app;
```

```js
// server.js
// --------------------------

// DEPENDENCIES
const app = require("./app.js");

// CONFIGURATION
require("dotenv").config();

## A Common Error

```js
// WRONG
// --------------------------
app.get("/rocks/oops/:index", (req, res) => {
  const { index } = req.params;
  res.send(rocks[index]);
  // error cannot send more than one response!
  res.send("this is the index: " + index);
});
```

```js
// RIGHT
// --------------------------
app.get("/rocks/:index", (req, res) => {
  const { index } = req.params;
  if (rocks[index]) {
    res.send(rocks[index]);

  //:index can be anything, even awesome
  res.send(rocks[req.params.index]);
});

app.get("/rocks/awesome", (req, res) => {
  //this will never be reached
  res.send(`
 <h1>Rocks are awesome!</h1>
 <img src="https://tinyurl.com/2s7emynd" />
 `);
});
```

```js
// RIGHT
// --------------------------
app.get("/rocks/awesome", (req, res) => {
  res.send(`
 <h1>rocks are awesome!</h1>
 <img src="https://tinyurl.com/2s7emynd" />
 `);
});

app.get("/rocks/:index", (req, res) => {
  const { index } = req.params;
  if (rocks[index]) {

  console.log("This is req.query", req.query);
  const sum = req.query.num1 + req.query.num2;
  res.send("sum is " + sum);
});
```

```js
// Code cleaned up
app.get("/calculator/:operator", (req, res) => {
  const { num1, num2 } = req.query;
  const sum = Number(num1) + Number(num2);
  res.send("sum is " + sum);
});
```

```js
// Even more logic
app.get("/calculator/:operator", (req, res) => {
  const { num1, num2 } = req.query;
  let sum = 0;
  if ((req.params.operator === "add")) {
    sum = Number(num1) + Number(num2);
