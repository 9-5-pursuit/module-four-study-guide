# Express CRUD

| Term | Definition |
| ---- | ---------- |
| __CRUD__ | An acronym for Create, Read, Update, and Delete. It represents the basic operations performed on data in a persistent storage system, such as a database. |
Certainly! Here are simplified definitions for each letter in the CRUD acronym:
| **Create** | Create refers to the operation of adding new records or entries to a database or storage system. In Express, it involves sending data to a server endpoint using HTTP POST requests. |
| **Read** | Read refers to the operation of retrieving or fetching existing records or data from a database or storage system. In Express, it involves retrieving data from a server endpoint using HTTP GET requests. |
| **Update** | Update refers to the operation of modifying or changing existing records or data in a database or storage system. In Express, it involves sending data to a server endpoint using HTTP PUT or PATCH requests. |
| **Delete** | Delete refers to the operation of removing or deleting existing records or data from a database or storage system. In Express, it involves requesting the deletion of data from a server endpoint using HTTP DELETE requests. |
| __RESTful API__ | Stands for Representational State Transfer. It is an architectural style for designing networked applications that adhere to a set of principles, such as using HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for different operations and representing resources as URLs.|

## Overview

The examples assume that you have a basic Express app setup already and will focus on the code required to implement CRUD operations. Things like importing modules and setting up the server are omitted for brevity.

## Create (POST)

```js
// Middleware to parse JSON data
// This middleware should be included globally in your app, we're showing it in the example snippets to reflect that it's required for the operation
app.use(express.json());

// Route for creating data
app.post('/items', (req, res) => {
  const { name, description } = req.body;

  if (!name || !description) {
    return res.status(400).json({ message: 'Name and description are required' });
  }

  const newItem = {
    id: generateUniqueId(), // Assuming a function generateUniqueId() generates a unique identifier
    name,
    description
  };

  items.push(newItem);

  res.status(201).json({ message: 'Item created successfully', item: newItem });
});
```

<details>
<summary><strong>What middleware is used in the provided code snippet to parse JSON data from the request body?</strong></summary>

The middleware used to parse JSON data from the request body in the provided code snippet is `express.json()`. This middleware automatically parses the incoming request body when it contains JSON data, making it accessible in the `req.body` object.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>In the route handler function for the Create operation, how is the data extracted from the request body?</strong></summary>

To extract data from the request body in the route handler function for the Create operation, we use the `req.body` object. This object contains the parsed data sent in the request body. In the provided code snippet, the data is destructured using `const { name, description } = req.body;`, where `name` and `description` correspond to the properties sent in the request body.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What status code is returned in the response to indicate a successful creation of a record?</strong></summary>

When a record is successfully created, the response includes a status code of `201` (Created). This status code indicates that the request has been fulfilled, and a new resource has been created as a result.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How is the newly created item included in the response to the client?</strong></summary>

To include the newly created item in the response to the client, it is added to a JSON object. In the provided code snippet, the item is included in the response using the `item` property of the JSON object. For example, `res.status(201).json({ message: 'Item created successfully', item: newItem });` includes the `newItem` object in the response, allowing the client to access the created item's details.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What does the <code>generateUniqueId()</code> function represent in the provided code snippet?</strong></summary>

The `generateUniqueId()` function in the provided code snippet represents a function that generates a unique identifier for the newly created item. This function is used to assign a unique ID to the item before it is added to the `items` array.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What is the purpose of the conditional statement checking for the presence of <code>name</code> and <code>description</code> in the provided code snippet?</strong></summary>

The conditional statement checking for the presence of `name` and `description` in the provided code snippet is used to handle the scenario where the request body does not contain the required properties. If either `name` or `description` is missing, the route handler function returns a status code of `400` (Bad Request) and a message indicating that the name and description are required.
</details>

## Read (GET)

```js
app.get('/items', (req, res) => {
  // Return all items
  res.status(200).json({ items });
});
```

<details>
<summary><strong>In the provided code snippet, what route is defined for handling the Read operation?</strong></summary>

In the provided code snippet, the route `/items` is defined for handling the Read operation. This means that the route handler function will be executed when a GET request is sent to the `/items` endpoint.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>In the provided code snippet, if you wanted to return a single item by its ID, how would you modify the route handler function?</strong></summary>

To return a single item by its ID in the provided code snippet, we would need to modify the route handler function to accept a parameter for the item ID. For example, `app.get('/items/:id', (req, res) => { ... });` would allow us to access the item ID using `req.params.id`.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How would you handle a scenario where no items are found for the Read operation? What status code and response message would you use?</strong></summary>

To handle a scenario where no items are found for the Read operation, we would need to check if the `items` array is empty. If it is empty, we would return a status code of `404` (Not Found) and a message indicating that no items were found. For example, `res.status(404).json({ message: 'No items found' });` would return a `404` status code and a JSON object containing the message `No items found`.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What status code is returned in the response to indicate a successful retrieval of a record?</strong></summary>

When a record is successfully retrieved, the response includes a status code of `200` (OK). This status code indicates that the request has succeeded and that the response body contains the requested resource.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What is the difference between the `res.send` and `res.json` methods?</strong></summary>

The `res.send` method sends a response of various types, such as a string, an array, or an object. The `res.json` method sends a JSON response, which can be an object or an array. In the provided code snippet, the `res.json` method is used to send a JSON response containing an array of items.
</details>

## Update (PUT)

```js
// Middleware to parse JSON data
// This middleware should be included globally in your app, we're showing it in the example snippets to reflect that it's required for the operation
app.use(express.json());

// Route for updating data
app.put('/items/:id', (req, res) => {
  const itemId = parseInt(req.params.id);
  const { name, description } = req.body;

  // Find the item with the specified ID
  const itemToUpdate = items.find(item => item.id === itemId);

  if (!itemToUpdate) {
    return res.status(404).json({ message: 'Item not found' });
  }

  // Update the item properties
  itemToUpdate.name = name || itemToUpdate.name;
  itemToUpdate.description = description || itemToUpdate.description;

  res.status(200).json({ message: 'Item updated successfully', item: itemToUpdate });
});
```

<details>
<summary><strong>What HTTP method is commonly used for the Update operation in Express?</strong></summary>

The HTTP method commonly used for the Update operation in Express is `PUT`. This method is used to replace all current representations of the target resource with the request payload.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>In the provided code snippet, what route is defined for handling the Update operation?</strong></summary>

In the provided code snippet, the route `/items/:id` is defined for handling the Update operation. This means that the route handler function will be executed when a PUT request is sent to the `/items/:id` endpoint, where `:id` is a route parameter.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How does the route parameter <code>:id</code> in the route path contribute to the Update operation?</strong></summary>

The route parameter `:id` in the route path allows us to access the item ID using `req.params.id`. This allows us to find the item with the specified ID in the `items` array.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How is the item to be updated retrieved from the items array in the provided code snippet?</strong></summary>

In the provided code snippet, the item to be updated is retrieved from the `items` array using the `find` method. The `find` method returns the first item in the array that satisfies the provided testing function. In this case, the testing function is `(item => item.id === itemId)`, which returns the item with the specified ID.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What is the purpose of the conditional statement checking for the existence of <code>itemToUpdate</code> in the provided code snippet?</strong></summary>

The conditional statement checking for the existence of `itemToUpdate` in the provided code snippet is used to handle the scenario where no item is found with the specified ID. If no item is found, the route handler function returns a status code of `404` (Not Found) and a message indicating that the item was not found.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can you provide an example of how you would modify the route path to include additional parameters for updating data based on specific conditions?</strong></summary>

To include additional parameters for updating data based on specific conditions, we would need to modify the route path to include additional route parameters. For example, `app.put('/items/:id/:name', (req, res) => { ... });` would allow us to access the item ID using `req.params.id` and the item name using `req.params.name`.
</details>


## Delete (DELETE)

```js
app.delete('/items/:id', (req, res) => {
  const itemId = parseInt(req.params.id);

  // Find the index of the item with the specified ID
  const itemIndex = items.findIndex(item => item.id === itemId);

  if (itemIndex === -1) {
    return res.status(404).json({ message: 'Item not found' });
  }

  // Remove the item from the array
  items.splice(itemIndex, 1);

  res.status(200).json({ message: 'Item deleted successfully' });
});
```

<details>
<summary><strong>In the provided code snippet, what route is defined for handling the Delete operation?</strong></summary>

In the provided code snippet, the route `/items/:id` is defined for handling the Delete operation. This means that the route handler function will be executed when a DELETE request is sent to the `/items/:id` endpoint, where `:id` is a route parameter.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What is the purpose of the <code>:id</code> parameter in the route path for the Delete operation?</strong></summary>

The `:id` parameter in the route path for the Delete operation allows us to access the item ID using `req.params.id`. This allows us to find the item with the specified ID in the `items` array.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How is the item to be deleted found in the items array in the provided code snippet?</strong></summary>

In the provided code snippet, the item to be deleted is found in the `items` array using the `findIndex` method. The `findIndex` method returns the index of the first item in the array that satisfies the provided testing function. In this case, the testing function is `(item => item.id === itemId)`, which returns the index of the item with the specified ID.
</detail>

<details>
<summary><strong>What is the purpose of checking the value of itemIndex in the provided code snippet?</strong></summary>

The purpose of checking the value of `itemIndex` in the provided code snippet is to handle the scenario where no item is found with the specified ID. If no item is found, the route handler function returns a status code of `404` (Not Found) and a message indicating that the item was not found.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What is the purpose of the <code>splice</code> method in the provided code snippet?</strong></summary>

The `splice` method in the provided code snippet is used to remove the item from the `items` array. The `splice` method changes the contents of an array by removing or replacing existing elements and/or adding new elements.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What is the purpose of the <code>parseInt</code> function in the provided code snippet?</strong></summary>

The `parseInt` function in the provided code snippet is used to convert the item ID to an integer. This is necessary because the item ID is retrieved from the request parameters, which are always strings.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What alternative methods could you use to accomplish the same task as the <code>parsInt</code> function in the provided code snippet?</strong></summary>

To accomplish the same task as the `parseInt` function in the provided code snippet, we could use the `Number` constructor or the `+` operator. For example, `const itemId = Number(req.params.id);` or `const itemId = +req.params.id;` would both convert the item ID to an integer.
